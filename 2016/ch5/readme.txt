Automatic properties and defaut values,


when use automatic properties to encapsulate numerical or boolean data, you are able to uset the autogenerated type properites straightway within your cde base, as the hidden backing field will be assigneda  safe default values.

but if you used automatci propery sntzs to wrap another class var, the hidden private fer type will also be set to a default val of NULL. 


so nedd update class construtor to ensure the obj comes to life in a safe mmannyer
